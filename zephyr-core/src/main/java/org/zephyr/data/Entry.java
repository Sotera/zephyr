/**
 * An Entry is a value with a label, a value (usually normalized and validated), a list of types, a visibility field for
 * analytics or databases that might require it (depending on which analytic or database it is, it may require some form of conversion), and a metadata field.
 * <p/>
 * The metadata field can be used in whatever way makes sense for your ETL process. One use for it can be that the same metadata
 * string in multiple entries indicates a grouping between them.
 * <p/>
 * You might put "source" in for metadata on both the latitude and longitude categorized values, and you might put "destination" in for metadata on the others.
 * <p/>
 * It is then up to your writer to determine how best to put this data into the final location.
